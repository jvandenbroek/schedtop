.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
This program is a free (GPL) utility to process various scheduler related statistics (e.g. /proc/schedstat) such that the "busiest" stats (greatest delta) will bubble up to the top similar to the ubiquitous "top" utility. It can alternately be sorted by the stat's value, or by name. Stats can be inclusively or exclusively filtered based on reg-ex pattern matching.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP
To filter out any stats with "sched_info" or "imbalance" in the name, use the exclude filter with an OR operator:
.LP
   schedtop -x 'sched_info|imbalance'
.LP
To include only stats from cpu3, and sort by value:
.LP
   schedtop -i cpu3 -s v
